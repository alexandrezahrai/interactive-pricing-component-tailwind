- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### What I learned

I learned a lot about range type inputs and how to manipulate and style them!

### Useful resources

- [How To - Range Sliders](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) - This gave me a basic overview of how range sliders work.
- [<input type="range">](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) - This resource gave me a more indepth overview of the range input type.
